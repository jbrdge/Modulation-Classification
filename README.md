# Modulation-Classification
My final project for Machine Learning ECE 523 at University of Arizona. Neural Network Classifier of various signals.

Signal generator created by Garrett Vanhoy in Matlab. Utilizing this signal generator, my project partner Andrew Burger and I
created a Neural Network for classification of the signals.
